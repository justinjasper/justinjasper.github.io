#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi there, it's nice to meet you!

My name is Justin and I'm a student at Stanford University studying Bioengineering (B.S.) and Computer Science (M.S.) with a focus in Artificial Intelligence. 

I'm deeply passionate about leveraging the intersection of computational biology and machine learning to tackle complex challenges in biomedical research and development. My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in developing AI-driven solutions, analyzing biological data, and conducting cross-collaborative data-driven research.


If you'd like to chat/grab coffee, or you'd like to work together, feel free to email me at jtjasper[at]stanford[dot]edu.
