#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi there, it's nice to meet you!

My name is Justin and I'm a student at <span class="nice-purple">Stanford University</span> studying <span class="nice-purple">Bioengineering (B.S.)</span> and <span class="nice-purple">Computer Science (M.S.)</span> with a focus in <span class="nice-purple">Artificial Intelligence</span>. 

I'm deeply passionate about leveraging the intersection of computational biology and machine learning to tackle complex challenges in biomedical research and development. My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in developing AI-driven solutions, analyzing biological data, and conducting cross-collaborative data-driven research.


If you'd like to chat/grab coffee, or you'd like to work together, feel free to email me at <span class="nice-purple">jtjasper</span>[at]<span class="nice-purple">stanford</span>[dot]<span class="nice-purple">edu</span>.
